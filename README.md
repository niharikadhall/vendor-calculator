Developing a Vendor Selection Website for Sustainable Sourcing, designed to help businesses make
informed, data-driven sourcing decisions while ensuring environmental and social compliance. The
platform integrates real-time carbon footprint tracking, social sustainability assessment, and a
scoring mechanism to evaluate vendors based on key sustainability and operational metrics.
Buyers can add, manage, and assess suppliers, enabling transparent and responsible sourcing. The
system also suggests optimisation strategies to lower environmental impact and enhance supply
chain efficiency. The final prototype aims to help businesses reduce compliance risks, improve
sustainability reporting, and achieve cost-effective, eco-conscious procurement.
